# ADAL-Final-
for personal uses
# prompt for pseudocode , tc & sc and input 

I will paste a code below.
Give me ONLY the following:

1. Pseudocode

Write clean, simple pseudocode (no programming syntax).

2. Time Complexity

Give detailed time complexity analysis:

Recurrence (if applicable)

Step-by-step simplification

Final Big-O

3. Space Complexity

Give detailed space complexity analysis:

Variables

Arrays / extra storage

Recursion depth (if any)

Final Big-O

4. Input Format (neatly)

Just rewrite the input style in clean format (no example dry run).

❗ DO NOT add any extra explanation, theory, advantages, or applications.
❗ STRICTLY output only these 4 sections.

Now wait for me to paste the code.




# prompt for dry run 

I will paste a code.
I want you to give me a full code-wise dry run in the exact format below:

✅ 1. “Line-by-Line Code Explanation”

Explain every line of the code in simple beginner-friendly English.
Tell what each variable means, how loops run, how conditions behave.

✅ 2. “Execution Flow Explanation”

Explain how the program starts, what function runs first, what values get passed, and how control flows in each function call.

✅ 3. “Dry Run Table (Step-by-Step)”

For the input I will provide, make a table showing for each step:

Current line of code

Current state of variables

What condition is checked

What decisions are made

If recursion is involved → show each call, stack level, and return values

✅ 4. “Visualization of Algorithm”

Give a simple visual diagram (tree/table/path/array updates as needed).
Explain what is happening in each major step.

✅ 5. “Final Output Explanation”

Explain how the program reached final output step-by-step.

⚠️ IMPORTANT:
Please do the dry run exactly according to the code flow, not generic algorithm theory.

Now wait for me to paste my code and input.
